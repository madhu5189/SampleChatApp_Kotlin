# SampleChatApp_Kotlin
Sample chat application in Kotlin

In this application, the user can register/login.
Once the user is logged in, the latest messages screen is shown,
where all the latest messages received by the user is displayed in a list format.

Also, there is a "New Message" option at the top, on click of which a screen with a list of the users registerd
using this app is shown. On selecting any one of the users, the chat history with that user is displayed.
There is also "Log Out" option available.

Initially, when the user logs in for the first time, the latest messages screen will be empty, as there
are no messages linked to that user yet in the database. 
You can start a new message chain using the "New Message" option as mentioned above.
